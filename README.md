# Learn Pipeline Architecture
This is a work in progress yet...

This is my first experience with design and implement a pipeline pattern. I read different resources, see some examples and put here what I learned. 
If you read about pipeline you will see that people use the term Filter. I use the name IOperation instead of IFilter, it makes more sence for me.

I need to make some unit tests and put here some explanation about this pattern.
